# Architectural Decision Support System (ADSS)
**Bridging Business Strategy and Technical Implementation**  
*An framework for optimizing architecture decisions through prioritized softgoal mapping*

## Core Concept
A collaborative platform where:
- **Business Experts** define strategic priorities through weighted softgoals  
- **Technical Experts** translate these into optimal architectural patterns  
- **MDCN Algorithm** recommends non-functional pattern enhancements  

Resolves the classic "Business-Technical Alignment Gap" through traceable decision workflows.

## Key Features

### Business Perspective
- Priority-weighted softgoal definition  
- Conflict resolution dashboard  
- Strategic decision audit trail  

### Technical Perspective
- Pattern recommendation engine  
- Trade-off analysis matrix  
- MDCN-enhanced architecture validation  

### Cross-Functional
