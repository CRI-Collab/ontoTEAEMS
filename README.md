# Architectural Decision Support System (ADSS)
**Bridging Business Strategy and Technical Implementation**  
*An framework for optimizing architecture decisions through prioritized softgoal mapping*

## 🔍 Core Concept
A collaborative platform where:
- **Business Experts** define strategic priorities through weighted softgoals  
- **Technical Experts** translate these into optimal architectural patterns  
- **MDCN Algorithm** recommends non-functional pattern enhancements  

Resolves the classic "Business-Technical Alignment Gap" through traceable decision workflows.
